ISTRICI is a software based on SU and fortran codes to determine seismic velocity in selected layers by using Common Image Gather (CIG) analysis

ISTRICI was developed to facilitate the use of Seismic Unix, free software designed to process seismic data. 

ISTRICI consists of three boxes (INTER, CIG and TRAD) for interactively performing residual velocity analysis and pre-stack depth migration, switching from one box to the next depending on the quality and type of seismic data.

For more details about the Seismic Unix (SU) command and adopted algorithms, you can see the SU help, just typing the name of the command

The list of available command can be visualised typing "suhelp" or "suname"

Please, consulte ximage and suximage help in order to know as to perform the picking!

Copy the ISTRICI/CIG_V1, ISTRICI/INTER_V1 and ISTRICI/TRAD_V1 directory in the directory where the analysis will be performed.
