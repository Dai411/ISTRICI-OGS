TRAD_V1 is a software based on SU and fortran codes to determine seismic velocity by using Common Image Gather (CIG) analysis.

For more details about the Seismic Unix (SU) command and adopted algorithms, you can see the SU help, just typing the name of the command.

The list of available command can be visualised typing "suhelp" or "suname".

Please, consulte ximage and suximage help in order to know as to perform the picking!


-----------------
First of all, copy the TRAD_V1 directory in the directory where the analysis will be performed

-----------------
Then, you need to create the Seimic Unix file, by using, for example, the following commands:

segyread tape=file.sgy endian=0 conv=1 | segyclean >file.su

-----------------
Check if the coordinates (trace header sx and gx) are stored in the SU file. If not, you can use the sushw command, such as:

sushw <file.su key=sx,offset a=XX,xx b=0,xx c=XX,0 j=XX,xx | suchw key1=gx key2=sx key3=offset a=0 b=1 c=1 >file_coo.su

or

suchw <file.su key1=sx key2=fldr a=XX b=XX | suchw key1=gx key2=sx key3=offset a=0 b=1 c=1 >file_coo.su

Remove not necessary headers in the su file

-----------------
Create the initial vfile, the binary velocity field with constant velocity. 
In this step, you need to decide the geometry parameters of the grid: nx,dx,nz,dz

Input: nx,nz,constant velocity

sh TRAD_V1/CreateVfile

Output: vfile, given filename for the initial vfile

-----------------
1. Perform the Pre-stack Depth Migration and create the stacked migrated section

Input: vfile, seismic data

sh TRAD_V1/PerformPSDM

Output: kd.data_complete (migration), outfile1_complete (additional migration), stackPSDM.su (stack of the CIGs)

-----------------
2. Extraction of selected CIGs to perform the velocity analysis
In this step, you decide the CIG step for the velocity analysis.

Input: kd.data_complete (migration), outfile1_complete (additional migration)

sh TRAD_V1/CIGextraction

Output: kd.data, outfile1

The output files are used to perform the velocity analysis.  

----------------
3. Update of velocity field (vfile) by using CIG analysis


sh TRAD_V1/UPDATEvelocity 

Output: updated vfile

Suggestion: change the name of the updated vfile!
Note that the old files are saved in filename_old

In the case of marine seismic data, it could be necessary to fix the seawater velocity (previusly obtained by using INTER box, for example), 
to perform the velocity analysis. It possibile to use:

Input: horizon.dat (depth of seafloor picked on final Pre-stacked migrated section obtained with INTER).

sh TRAD_V1/UPDATEvelocity2marinedata

Output: updated vfile

-----------------

REPEATE the steps 1-3 until you obtain a satisfactory velocity field. When you decide that the velocity model for the whole line is satisfactory, you perform the last pre-stack depth migration (step 68). Before performing the last migration, a velocity gradient can be inserted (step 57). 

-----------------
4. Insert a velocity gradient below a chosen surface

input: vfile, velocity gradient, horizon from where the gradient is inserted.

sh TRAD_V1/InsertVelocityGradient

Output: new vfile

Suggestion: change the name of the new vfile

-----------------
5. Smooth the vfile and perform the final pre-stack depth migration
kd.data_complete
Input: vfile and its parameters, seismic data 

sh TRAD_V1/PerformLastPSDM

Output: vfile_smooth, kd.data_complete, stackFinalPSDM.su 

Suggestion: you can improve the final stacked section by using only selected offset in the CIG to create a stacked section. 

-----------------

GENERAL SUGGESTION: in order to remember the adopted parameters, it is possible to create a input file information.

---------------------
6. Merge the velocity model obtained with TRAD_V1 box with that one obtained with CIG_V1 or INTER_V1 boxes.
This step allows inserting layers attributing them a mean velocity.

Input: chosen vfile, stackFPSDM.su

sh VEL2Layer

Output: new vfile
