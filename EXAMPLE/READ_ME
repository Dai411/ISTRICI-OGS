vfile1500 file is the initial velocity field in binary format. To visualize the initial velocity field:
ximage < vfile1500 n1=201 n2=921 d2=50 d1=25 legend=1

Shot_sx4800 file is the raw seismic data of one shot. To visualize the seismic data:

suximage < Shot_sx4800 perc=98

CIG4800 file is the Common Image Gather resulting from the application of the INTER and TRAD modules,
as described in the paper Tinivella & Giustiniani (Computers & Geosciences).
 
suximage < CIG4800 perc=98

XX is the final velocity field. To visualize the final velocity field:

ximage < XXX n1=201 n2=921 d2=50 d1=25 legend=1
